# mockingjay server

Mockingjay server creates HTTP web servers for integration tests from JSON configuration and then compares them against real servers to ensure they are valid to test against.

Mockingjay is fast, requires no coding and is better than other solutions because it will ensure your mock servers and real integration points are consistent.

## TODO

- Basically everything
- Pretty diagrams explaining it all (interations between fakes, CDCs et al.)
- Not hard code JSON, instead get file path from stdin
- Fail gracefully
