# mockingjay server

Mockingjay server creates HTTP web servers for integration tests from JSON configuration and then compares them against real servers to ensure they are valid to test against.

Mockingjay is fast, requires no coding and is better than other solutions because it will ensure your mock servers and real integration points are consistent.
